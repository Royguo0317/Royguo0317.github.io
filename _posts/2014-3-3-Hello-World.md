title: A personal project I worded on
    
    I worked on a samll project after I finished 3 months of learning of JavaScrpt. It was a web game which simulate the popular game "Doodle Jump". It was pretty fun and I still remember the moment when I finished the project and got the game running. It was amazing!

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
